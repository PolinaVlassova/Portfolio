## 1 Task

In the 200m dash finals in the Olympics, 8 runners compete for 3 medals (order matters). In the 2012 Olympics, 3 of the 8 runners were from Jamaica and the other 5 were from different countries. The three medals were all won by Jamaica (Usain Bolt, Yohan Blake, and Warren Weir). Calculate analytically first two, simulate the last one (1,000 runs).


### a.  Number of ways to distribute 3 medals across 8 runners
```{r}
ways_to_distribute_medals = factorial(8)/factorial(8-3)
ways_to_distribute_medals
```

### b. Number of different ways to distribute 3 medals among 3 Jamaican runners
```{r}
ways_to_distribute_medals_jamaica = factorial(3)
ways_to_distribute_medals_jamaica
```
### c. Probability that all 3 medals are won by Jamaica
```{r}
probability_all_medals_jamaica = ways_to_distribute_medals_jamaica / ways_to_distribute_medals
probability_all_medals_jamaica
```

```{r}
# Function to check if all medals are awarded to Jamaica
isAllJamaica = function(order) {
  all(order[1:3] %in% c("Jamaica1", "Jamaica2", "Jamaica3"))
}

# Number of simulations
num_simulations = 1000000

# Variable to count how many times all 3 medals go to Jamaica
jamaica_medal_count <- 0

# Names of the 8 runners
runners = c("Jamaica1", "Jamaica2", "Jamaica3", "Runner4", "Runner5", "Runner6", "Runner7", "Runner8")

# Simulation
for (i in 1:num_simulations) {
  # Shuffle the order of the runners randomly
  shuffled_order = sample(runners)
  
  # If all 3 medals are awarded to Jamaica 
  if (isAllJamaica(shuffled_order)) {
    jamaica_medal_count = jamaica_medal_count + 1
  }
}

# Probability
probability = jamaica_medal_count / num_simulations

## 2 Task

Imagine deck of poker cards â€“ 13 different cards in 4 suits, hence 52 different cards. Obtain results analytically and via simulations of at least 1,000 runs for each of the following questions.

### a. You sample 5 cards at random without replacement, what is a probability of having five cards of the same suit?

Solution: 5/52 -  drawing of  5 cards
13/42 - number of cards with the same suit
Without replacement

-> same suits: 4 * (13/52 * 12/51 * 11/50 * 10/49 * 9/48) = 0.001965

```{r}
set.seed(123)

# Function to draw 5 cards of the same suit without replacement
draw_hand_same_suit = function() {
  deck = sample(1:52, 5)
  return(deck)
}

# Function to check if all cards in the hand belong to the same suit
same_suit = function(hand) {
  suits = (hand - 1) %/% 13  # Determine the suit of each card (0-3)
  return(all(suits == suits[1]))
}

# Number of simulations
num_simulations = 100000

# Number of cases with same suit
count_same_suit = 0

# Simulation
for (i in 1:num_simulations) {
  hand = draw_hand_same_suit()
  if (same_suit(hand)) {
    count_same_suit = count_same_suit + 1
  }
}

# Calculation of probability
simulated_probability = count_same_suit / num_simulations
cat("Simulated Probability:", simulated_probability, "\n")


```
### b. You sample 2 cards at random without replacement, what is a probability of having two Kings?

Solution: there are 4 kings in the first draw and 3 kings in the second draw.

Without replacement

4/52 * 3/51 = 1/221 = 0.0045

```{r}
# Function to draw 2 cards without replacement
draw_2_cards = function() {
  deck = sample(1:52, 2)
  return(deck)
}

# Number of simulations
num_simulations = 100000

# Number of cases with 2 Kings
count_2_kings = 0

# Simulation
for (i in 1:num_simulations) {
  hand <- draw_2_cards()
  kings_in_hand <- sum(hand %% 13 == 0)  # Kings have a reminder of 0 when divided by 13
  if (kings_in_hand == 2) {
    count_2_kings = count_2_kings + 1
  }
}

# Calculation of probability
simulated_probability = count_2_kings / num_simulations
cat("Simulated Probability:", simulated_probability, "\n")


```


### c. What is a probability of having the second King in the second draw?

Solution: Probability of first king is 4/52, probability of second king is 3/51

4/52 * 3/51 = 0.004524887 

```{r}
# Function to draw 2 cards without replacement
draw_2_cards = function() {
  deck = sample(1:52, 2)
  return(deck)
}

# Number of simulations
num_simulations = 100000

# Number of drawing second King
count_second_king = 0

# Simulation

for (i in 1:num_simulations) {
  hand = draw_2_cards()
  if (hand[1] %% 13 == 0) {  # Check if the first card is a King
    if (hand[2] %% 13 == 0) {  # Check if the second card is also a King
      count_second_king <- count_second_king + 1
    }
  }
}

# Calculation of probability

simulated_probability = count_second_king / num_simulations
cat("Simulated Probability of having the second King on the second draw:", simulated_probability, "\n")
```
### d.You sample 5 cards at random without replacement, what is a probability of having exactly three different suits of one kind of a card.

Solution:

Choose one suit out of 4 suits in C(4, 1) ways.

Choose 3 cards from the chosen suit in C(13, 3) ways.

Choose 2 suits out of the remaining 3 suits in C(3, 2) ways.

Choose 1 card from each of the 2 chosen suits in C(13, 1) * C(13, 1) ways.


Probability = [C(4, 1) * C(13, 3) * C(3, 2) * (C(13, 1))^2] / C(52, 5)

```{r}
# Function to calculate combinations
combinations = function(n, k) {
  return(factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k)))
}

# Calculation of the probability
probability = (combinations(4, 1) * combinations(13, 3) * combinations(3, 1) * combinations(13, 1) * combinations(13, 1)) / combinations(52, 5)

cat("Probability:", probability, "\n")

```

```{r}
# Function to simulate and calculate the probability
simulate_probability = function(num_simulations) {
  favorable_outcomes = 0
  total_simulations = num_simulations
  
  for (i in 1:num_simulations) {
    deck <- rep(1:4, each = 13)  # Create a deck with 4 suits, 13 cards each
    sample_cards = sample(deck, 5, replace = FALSE)  # Sample 5 cards without replacement
    unique_suits = length(unique(sample_cards))
    
    # Check if there are exactly 3 different suits
    if (unique_suits == 3) {
      # Check if there is one suit with 3 cards
      for (suit in 1:4) {
        if (sum(sample_cards == suit) == 3) {
          favorable_outcomes = favorable_outcomes + 1
          break
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  # Calculation of the probability
  probability = favorable_outcomes / total_simulations
  return(probability)
}

# Number of simulations
num_simulations = 100000

# Calculation of the probability
result = simulate_probability(num_simulations)

```

## 3 Task

Assuming having a standardized admissions test has a -0.25 point penalty for every incorrect answer and awards 1 point for a correct answer. The quantitative test consists of 8 multiple-choice questions each with 5 answer choices. Suppose a student chooses answers by guessing for all questions on the test.

### a. Write down a probability function for total number of points obtained.

Solution: since there are 2 outcomes P(X)=1 (correct) and P(Y)=1-P(X) for incorrect. We need to use PMF function to derive a formula for Binomial Distribution:

P(X = x) = (n choose x) * (p^x) * ((1 - p)^(n - x))

P(X = x) = (8 choose x) * (p^x) * ((1 - p)^(8 - x))

### b. What is an expected value and standard deviation for total number of points?
```{r}
n = 8  # Total number of questions
p_correct = 1/5  # Probability of guessing correctly

# Calculate the expected value (mean)
expected_value = n * (p_correct * 1 + (1 - p_correct) * (-0.25))

# Calculate the variance using the formula
variance = n * p_correct * (1 - p_correct)

# Calculate the standard deviation
standard_deviation = sqrt(variance)

cat("Expected value  for total points:", expected_value, "\n")
cat("Standard deviation for total points:", standard_deviation, "\n")
```


### c. Simulate 1,000 students taking this test, guessing at random. What is their mean number of points and sample standard deviation?
```{r}
# Set the parameters
n_students = 1000
n = 8
p1 = 1/5
penalty = -0.25

# Create an empty vector to store the total scores
total_scores = numeric(n_students)

# Simulate the test for each student
for (i in 1:n_students) {
  correct_answers = dbinom(n, 1, p1)
  incorrect_answers = 1 - correct_answers
  total_score = sum(correct_answers) - (penalty * sum(incorrect_answers))
  total_scores[i] = total_score
}

# Calculate the mean and sample standard deviation
mean_score = mean(total_scores)
std_deviation = sd(total_scores)

cat("Mean number of points:", mean_score, "\n")
cat("Sample standard deviation:", std_deviation, "\n")

```
##4 Task
In a previous example, assume a student knows answers to 80 % of questions.
### a. What is his/her expected number of points and standard deviation assuming he/she skips answering those questions he/she does not know an answer to (and takes automatically 0 points for these)?

```{r}
# Set the parameters
n = 8  
p_know = 0.8  # Probability that the student knows the answer

# Calculate the expected number of points 
expected_points = p_know * n

cat("Expected number of points:", expected_points, "\n")
```

###b. What is his/her expected number of points and standard deviation assuming he/she answers randomly those questions he/she does not know an answer to?
```{r}
n = 8  
p_know = 0.8  # Probability that the student knows the answer
p_random = 1/5  # Probability of randomly guessing the answer
points_random = p_random * -0.25  # Points for random guesses with penalty

# Calculate the expected number of points
expected_points = (p_know * n) + (p_random * points_random *  n )

# Calculate the variance
variance = (p_know * (1 - p_know) * n ) + (p_random * (1 - p_random) * n )

# Calculate the standard deviation
standard_deviation = sqrt(variance)

cat("Expected number of points:", expected_points, "\n")
cat("Standard deviation:", standard_deviation, "\n")

```
###c. Simulate 1,000 pairs of students. The first student from the pair knows answers to 80 % of question and the second knows answers to 90 % of questions. What is the probability, that the first student has higher number of total points than the second assuming they skip answering questions they do not know the answer to?

```{r}
n = 8  
p_first_know = 0.8  # Probability that the first student knows the answer
p_second_know = 0.9  # Probability that the second student knows the answer
p_random = 1/5  # Probability of randomly guessing the answer
points_random = p_random * -0.25  # Points for random guesses 
num_simulations = 1000  # Number of pairs of students to simulate

# Counter for the cases where the first student has more points
count_higher_points = 0

# Simulate pairs of students
for (i in 1:num_simulations) {
  # Simulate the first student's test
  first_student_scores = rbinom(n, 1, p_first_know)
  first_student_points = sum(first_student_scores * 1 + (1 - first_student_scores) * points_random)
  
  # Simulate the second student's test
  second_student_scores = rbinom(n, 1, p_second_know)
  second_student_points = sum(second_student_scores * 1 + (1 - second_student_scores) * points_random)
  
  # Check if the first student has more points
  if (first_student_points > second_student_points) {
    count_higher_points = count_higher_points + 1
  }
}

# Calculate the probability that the first student has higher points
probability_higher_points = count_higher_points / num_simulations

cat("Probability that the first student has higher points:", probability_higher_points, "\n")
```
 
## Task 5
